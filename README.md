2.created an app name->    'spoken_ers'<br>
3.created template dir having 'base.html' file which will be the wrapper of our all  html files




# created a notebook having idea to find similarity between skill set of student
and jobs requirements. It has inbuilt sklearn functions as well as my own functions.
#It has cosine similarity approach,jacard and distance based approach.
#I assumed skills and job desc as important features.


# cleaned the dataset having skills,job description as an important parameter
1.removed unimportant features
2.label encoders
3.added skills acc to job titles.
4.grouped only technical and developers job
